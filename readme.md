**Introduction**

This is a simple API for CRUD 
operations for Providers and Service
Areas using Django Rest Framework.

Utilizing built-in methods of
DRF, these operations are managed
through model serializers.

**Issues**

Unfortunately I am new to Django and
I could not make geojson data type 
work, due to its dependencies and 
serializer.
